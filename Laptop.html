    		<p>"The product is worth it the color is nice and it easy to pair with the iPad. Though Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s going to last long but so far from two days of using it for online classes and note taking itâ€™s been performing well. There are times wherein if you donâ€™t use it for a minute or two you have to reconnect it for it to work."</p>
