    		<p>"Kudos to Pulp Spaces and Minimall! LS was shipped out on the same day I placed my order, and I received it the next day (South Luzon). LS Box was secured with corrugated box and bubble wrap so there are no dents. LS is working and connects with the app w/o issue ü§ç"</p>

    		<p>"Superrrrr gandaaa sobrang bright ng ilaw, adjustable rin ang brightness (pag naka connect sa app) may included 9 photocards and makakaco-connect pa sa bini lightstick app. Fast delivery pa inorder ko siya ng Feb 4 nang gabi then dumating ng Feb 6 nang umaga. Sana lang matibay at magtagal. Sobrang worth it hindi nakakapangsisi bilhin üå∏. Ready na for GBVR! üåü"</p>
